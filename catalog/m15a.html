Improves students' ability to develop strategic communications that use data to persuade others to take action. Primary focus is on reducing barriers to action by making data as easy as possible for others to absorb through clear structure, clear design, and clear delivery. Significant time will be devoted to practice. Students give and receive substantial feedback on their work.
