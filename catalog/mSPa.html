<br><img alt="______" src="/icns/hr.gif">
<br>Interphase is a seven-week program designed to enhance the academic success of students entering MIT. The program has a dual focus: it gives students an introduction to the MIT experience by exposing them to the rigors of a full subject load while simultaneously preparing them for academic success beyond MIT. The program includes calculus; chemistry; physical education; physics; writing, oral presentation and teamwork skills; and supporting academic activities, including small-group learning. Students can earn transcript credit for subjects taken in the program, sometimes resulting in advanced placement in corresponding subjects taken in the Fall. Activities include day trips to area cultural, recreational, and business sites. Students participate in a range of personal and educational development seminars and activities designed to ensure their smooth transition to college life.

<br>Each spring, first-year students in the Terrascope Learning Community spend a week exploring a sustainability-related problem in an off-campus site. During the trip, students engage with communities affected by the problem and people taking a wide range of approaches to address it. In this course, students will integrate and communicate their experience from the trip, with the aim of deepening their consideration of the year's problem and how the field experience impacts their thoughts about their own pathways through MIT and beyond. Students will learn about best practices and opportunities for civic engagement related to the year's topic, and they will explore ways of communicating their learnings from the field experience. Limited to first-year students participating in the Terrascope spring break field experience.

<br>An exploration of radio as a medium of expression and communication, particularly the communication of complex scientific or technical information to general audiences. Examines the ingredients of effective radio programming, drawing extensively on examples from both commercial and public radio. Student teams produce, assemble, narrate, record and broadcast/webcast radio programs on topics related to the complex environmental issue that is the focus of the year's Terrascope subjects. Includes multiple individual writing assignments that explore the constraints and opportunities in radio as a medium. Limited to 15 first-year students.

<br>MIT alumni pursuing sustainability-oriented careers describe ways in which their major and career choices have provided them with the lenses through which they see the problems they work to solve. Students participate in guided reflection, focused on making the discussion relevant to their own personal situations and affinities. Students strengthen their ability to think deeply about their goals, for MIT and for the world beyond, and come into direct contact with alumni who can continue to mentor them through this process. Open to all undergraduates, regardless of Terrascope affiliation.
