<br>Course spans the entire two-year Leaders for Global Operations (LGO) program, with a focus on leadership that blends theory and practice. During their first summer in the program, students reflect on exemplary leaders' stories in cases, the arts, journalism, philosophy, and social science, and evaluate their own previous leadership experience. During the succeeding four semesters, they apply the lessons they have learned in class to their off-campus internship and other activities at Sloan, and intensively review that experience as they reach the end of the program. Classes take the form of moderated discussion, with the expectation that students will participate fully in each session; students also submit short, written deliverables throughout the program.

Each week a successful MIT-alum entrepreneur forwards a brief on their major issue that had to be overcome. Guest speakers include prominent entrepreneurial role models. Student teams propose solutions for class discussion followed by the speaker's response and what they actually did and why. The speaker then relates the rest of the firm's development up to the present. Class begins with the research on the day's focus and ends with student teams creating one-page take-aways. Delta v, MIT Fuse, MIT 100K Finals, Sandbox or the EMBA Program are also accepted prereqs. Exemplifies the preferred dual-track entrepreneurial education, integrating academic research and practitioner experience.
