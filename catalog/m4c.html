<br>Introduces artistic practice and critical visual thinking through three studio-based projects using different scales and media, for instance, &quot;Body Extension,&quot; &quot;Shaping Time,&quot; &quot;Public Making,&quot; and/or &quot;Networked Cultures.&quot; Each project concludes with a final presentation and critique. Students explore sculptural, architectural, performative artistic methods; video and sound art; site interventions and strategies for artistic engagement in the public realm. Lectures, screenings, guest presentations, field trips, readings, and debates supplement studio practice. Also introduces students to the historic, cultural, and environmental forces affecting both the development of an artistic vision and the reception of a work of art. Lab fee required. Limited to 20.

At the end of the semester, students create projects that may involve artistic tools, collective learning experiences, creative processes, and transdisciplinary knowledge exchanges that demonstrate a new way of capturing, sustaining, and developing future heritage.
